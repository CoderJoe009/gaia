Gaia.ai is an AI solution for species identification in East African game parks. It uses camera traps and motion sensors (Terra) or drone deployments (Aero) to capture data. The AI model, which can run locally or in the cloud, identifies species and can be expanded for poaching detection, human presence monitoring, and environmental health tracking
